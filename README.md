# Audio Visibility Graph Network (aVgNet)

*Note:* this is work in progress...

The goal is to build a neural network capable of mapping raw microphone array correlations (a.k.a visibility graph matrices) to the image domain. We intend to support generating such visibility graphs for an arbitraty mic array size, targeting the signal directionality resolution of an eigenMike32.
